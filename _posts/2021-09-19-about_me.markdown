My name is Javier, I'm from Jaén, in Andalucía (southern Spain), and I'm based in Dubai 
working as a full-time Android engineer for Level Shoes, a globally recognized retail 
company specialized in the world of designer footwear and accessories. We create the best 
e-commerce platform ever together with an amazing team across several countries.


Starting from the beginning, I graduated from the University of Malaga, where I became 
more interested in programming and built my first Android app. Shortly after, I started 
working in Madrid as a software engineer and since then I have been permanently linked 
to this sector, working in both startups and large consulting firms, creating apps with 
millions of users and well recognized on Google Play.


I usually stay in places with good weather. I like the beach, the sun, healthy food, living 
in the city and the freedom of being able to travel anywhere with my laptop to be able to work 
from there. I consider myself a very methodical, organized and autonomous person, planner and 
very committed to my work, and this is something that I also apply to all areas of my life.


And what do I usually do in my free time? I usually spend it reading articles about technology, 
travel and cryptocurrencies and testing new features related to my work. Beyond the computer, I 
spend a lot of time reading books on psychology and personal development. After all, it is also 
necessary to know the programming language of our mind, isn't it? That's what neuro-linguistic 
programming is all about.


I am also passionate about tennis, a sport that I have watched and practiced since I was a child 
and to which I dedicate many hours a week, both in training and in competitions, and that I 
usually combine with the gym.


How do you see your future? My professional interests continue to focus on software engineering 
and Android apps development, although I am currently also interested in another sector, data 
analysis (with the aim of organizing, managing and extracting meaningful information and conclusions 
that are useful for a company) and in Kotlin Mobile Multiplatform (to create cross-platform apps).


If you think I can contribute to your company or if you want to know more about
the projects I have worked on as well as my technological skills, do not
hesitate to contact me. I am always open to new challenges and opportunities,
to listen to colleagues, industry experts and interesting people.
