My name is Javier, I'm from Ja√©n, in the south of Spain and since several years
ago I'm based in Madrid working as a full time remote Android engineer for
Virgin Media, together with an amazing team distributed across several countries.


I graduated from the University of Malaga, where I started to get more interested
in programming and where I built my first Android app. Since then, I have been
permanently linked to this sector, working both in start-ups and consulting
firms with large teams of programmers creating applications with millions of
users and well recognized on Google Play.


I consider myself a very methodical, organized and autonomous person, planner
and very committed to my work, and this is something that I also apply to all
areas of my life. I like the beach, the sun, living in the city and traveling
anywhere with my computer so I can work from there.


And what do I usually do in my free time? I usually spend it reading articles
about technology, cryptocurrencies and trying new things related to my work.
Beyond the computer, I spend a lot of time reading books on psychology and
personal development. After all, it is also necessary to know the programming
language of our mind, isn't it? That's what neuro-linguistic programming is all about.


I am also passionate about tennis, a sport that I have watched and practiced
since I was a child and to which I dedicate many hours a week, both in training
and in competitions.


How do you see your future? My professional interests continue in the development
of Android applications although I am currently more interested in projects such
as Kotlin Mobile Multiplatform and in other sectors such as data analysis.


If you think I can contribute to your company or if you want to know more about
the projects I have worked on as well as my technological skills, do not
hesitate to contact me. I am always open to new challenges and opportunities,
to listen to colleagues, industry experts and interesting people.
